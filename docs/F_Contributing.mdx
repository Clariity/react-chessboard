3. Create a branch for your PR
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
4. Set upstream remote
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard.git
   ```
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes by running storybook

## Commit Guidelines

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages and [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) for automated versioning, release notes, and publishing to npm. All commits are validated using [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/), so if your commit message does not follow the format, the commit will fail.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Breaking changes should be indicated by a `!` in the type. e.g. `feat!` or `fix!`.

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature (triggers minor version bump)
- `fix`: A bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
# Feature commit
git commit -m "feat: add support for custom board themes"

# Bug fix commit
git commit -m "fix: fix piece dragging on mobile devices"

# Documentation commit
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"

# Breaking change commit
git commit -m "feat!: change board orientation API"
```

### Semantic Release

The project uses semantic-release to automatically:

- Determine the next version number based on commit types
- Generate release notes
- Publish to npm
- Create git tags

Version bumps are determined by commit types:

- `feat` commits trigger a minor version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
- `fix` commits trigger a patch version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
- Commits with `feat!` or `fix!` in the type trigger a major version bump (1.1.2 -> 2.0.0)

## Project guidelines

### Dependencies

The project aims to maintain a minimal dependency footprint to ensure optimal performance, smaller bundle size, and reduce potential security risks. Here are our dependency guidelines:

- Keep dependencies to an absolute minimum
- All dependencies must be actively maintained
- Dependencies should have permissive licenses (MIT, Apache, etc.)
- Evaluate each new dependency carefully for:
  - Bundle size impact
  - Security implications
  - Maintenance status
  - Browser compatibility

#### Required Dependencies

- `react` ^19.0.0
- `react-dom` ^19.0.0

#### Development Dependencies

Development dependencies should also be kept minimal but include necessary tooling for:

- Building (rollup, typescript)
- Testing (storybook)
- Code quality (eslint, prettier)
- Release management (commitlint, semantic-release)

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No IE11 support required
- Mobile browser support for touch events

### Accessibility

- Use ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard interactions are available
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
