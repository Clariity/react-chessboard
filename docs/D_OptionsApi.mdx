# Options API

This page will explain how to use the options API for React Chessboard. It includes sections for each option for the component that also contain relevant examples of how to use them.

The component has a number of options that you can use to customise the component. These are passed in via the `options` prop to the `Chessboard` component. (or the `ChessboardProvider` component if you are using spare pieces or other features that require the context provider).

The code for these examples can be viewed by clicking the "Show code" button in the bottom right of the interactive examples. The code can also be viewed in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard/tree/main/docs/stories/options).

## Options

### `options.allowAutoScroll`

Controls whether dragging a piece near the edge of the window will automatically scroll the window.

**Default value:** `false`

**TypeScript type:** `boolean`

**Standard use case:** Enabling auto-scrolling when dragging pieces near the edge of the window. Could be used if the board is larger than the window.

<Canvas of={AllowAutoScrollStories.AllowAutoScroll} />

### `options.allowDragging`

Controls whether pieces can be dragged.

When set to true, pieces can be dragged and dropped, and by default will have `cursor: grab` style. When set to false, the pieces can no longer be dragged, and by default will have the `cursor: pointer` style.

**Default value:** `true`

**TypeScript type:** `boolean`

**Standard use case:** Disabling drag and drop functionality for the entire board.

<Canvas of={AllowDraggingStories.AllowDragging} />

### `options.allowDragOffBoard`

Controls whether pieces can be dragged off the board.

**Default value:** `true`

**TypeScript type:** `boolean`

**Standard use case:** Disabling the ability to drag pieces off the board.

<WarningMessage>
  <p>
    Due to how Storybook renders canvases in iframes, and how the
    `preventDragOffBoard` modifier works by calculating the position of the
    piece and the board,{' '}
    <strong>this story example will not work in the Storybook preview</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result, if your application adjusts the position of the board in a
    similar way with iframes, you may face similar issues. To see the example in
    action, please run the example in your own project.
  </p>
</WarningMessage>

<Canvas of={AllowDragOffBoardStories.AllowDragOffBoard} />

### `options.allowDrawingArrows`

Controls whether additional arrows can be added by holding down the right mouse button and dragging the mouse over the board.

**Default value:** `true`

**TypeScript type:** `boolean`

**Standard use case:** Disabling the ability to add arrows to the board.

<Canvas of={AllowDrawingArrowsStories.AllowDrawingArrows} />

### `options.alphaNotationStyle`

Controls the styling of the alpha notation (a-h) on the board. If you wish to instead hide the notation, set [`showNotation`](#optionsshownotation) to `false`.

If you wish to display different styles of notation on different coloured squares, you can use the [`darkSquareNotationStyle`](#optionsdarksquarenotationstyle) and [`lightSquareNotationStyle`](#optionslightsquarenotationstyle) props.

**Default value:**

```tsx
{
  fontSize: "13px",
  position: "absolute",
  bottom: 1,
  right: 4,
  userSelect: 'none',
}
```

**TypeScript type:** `React.CSSProperties`

**Standard use case:** Customizing the appearance of the board notation coordinates.

<Canvas of={AlphaNotationStyleStories.AlphaNotationStyle} />

### `options.animationDurationInMs`

Controls the duration of piece movement animations in milliseconds.

**Default value:** `300`

**TypeScript type:** `number`

**Standard use case:** Adjusting the speed of piece movements to match your application's feel.

<Canvas of={AnimationDurationInMsStories.AnimationDurationInMs} />

### `options.arrows`

Controls the base set of arrows on the board. By default, additional arrows can be added by holding down the right mouse button and dragging the mouse over the board. You can disable this by setting [`allowDrawingArrows`](#optionsallowdrawingarrows) to `false`.

By default, these arrows will not be automatically cleared when a square is clicked or a piece is dragged. Instead, you will need to clear them manually using the [`onSquareClick`](#optionsonsquareclick) or [`onPieceDrag`](#optionsonpiecedrag) prop and pass in a new value for this prop.

**Default value:** `[]`

**TypeScript type:**

```typescript
{
  startSquare: string;
  endSquare: string;
  color: string;
}
[];
```

**Standard use case:** Adding arrows to the board to indicate possible moves or attacks.

<Canvas of={ArrowsStories.Arrows} />

### `options.arrowOptions`

Controls the appearance and behavior of arrows on the board. This includes settings for arrow colors, width, length, and opacity.

#### Arrow colors

- `color`: Sets the default arrow color when no modifiers are held down when drawing an arrow
- `secondaryColor`: Sets the arrow color when shift is held down when drawing an arrow
- `tertiaryColor`: Sets the arrow color when control is held down when drawing an arrow

When drawing an arrow, you can hold down modifier keys to change the arrow color:

- Hold Shift to use `secondaryColor`
- Hold Control to use `tertiaryColor`
- If both Shift and Control are held down, Shift takes precedence

#### Arrow length

- `arrowLengthReducerDenominator`: Controls how much the arrow length is reduced. The lower the denominator, the greater the reduction (e.g. 8 = 1/8 of a square width removed, 4 = 1/4 of a square width removed)
- `sameTargetArrowLengthReducerDenominator`: Works the same way but specifically for arrows targeting the same square, using a greater reduction to avoid overlaps

#### Arrow width

- `arrowWidthDenominator`: Controls the width of the arrow. The lower the denominator, the greater the width (e.g. 5 = 1/5 of a square width, 10 = 1/10 of a square width)
- `activeArrowWidthMultiplier`: Sets the multiplier for the arrow width when it is being drawn

#### Arrow opacity

- `opacity`: Controls the opacity of arrows when not being drawn
- `activeOpacity`: Controls the opacity of arrows when they are being drawn

**Default value:**

```tsx
{
  color: "#ffaa00", // yellow
  secondaryColor: "#4caf50", // green
  tertiaryColor: "#f44336", // red
  arrowLengthReducerDenominator: 8,
  sameTargetArrowLengthReducerDenominator: 4,
  arrowWidthDenominator: 5,
  activeArrowWidthMultiplier: 0.9,
  opacity: 0.65,
  activeOpacity: 0.5,
}
```

**TypeScript type:**

```typescript
{
  color: string,
  secondaryColor: string,
  tertiaryColor: string,
  arrowLengthReducerDenominator: number,
  sameTargetArrowLengthReducerDenominator: number,
  arrowWidthDenominator: number,
  activeArrowWidthMultiplier: number,
  opacity: number,
  activeOpacity: number
}
```

**Standard use case:** Customizing the appearance of arrows to match your application's theme or to make them more or less prominent.

<Canvas of={ArrowOptionsStories.ArrowOptions} />

### `options.boardOrientation`

Controls the orientation of the board. When set to "black", the board is flipped so black pieces are at the bottom.

**Default value:** `"white"`

**TypeScript type:** `"white" | "black"`

**Standard use case:** Allowing players to view the board from the perspective of the pieces they are playing with.

<Canvas of={BoardOrientationStories.BoardOrientation} />

### `options.boardStyle`

Controls the styling of the entire chessboard container.

**Default value:**

```tsx
{
  display: "grid",
  gridTemplateColumns: `repeat(${chessboardColumns}, 1fr)`,
  overflow: "hidden",
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',
  position: 'relative',
}
```

**TypeScript type:** `React.CSSProperties`

**Standard use case:** Adding custom styling like borders, shadows, or rounded corners to the board.

<Canvas of={BoardStyleStories.BoardStyle} />

### `options.canDragPiece`

Controls whether a piece can be dragged.

**Default value:** `undefined`

**TypeScript type:**

```typescript
({
  isSparePiece: boolean;
  piece: { pieceType: string };
  square: string | null;
}) => boolean;
```

**Standard use case:** Restricting piece dragging to certain pieces or squares.

<Canvas of={CanDragPieceStories.CanDragPiece} />

### `options.chessboardColumns`

Controls the number of columns on the chessboard. If you set either of the row or column options above `9`, you will need to use the `positionObject` notation for the `position` prop, as `fen` notation only supports single digit columns.

**Default value:** `8`

**TypeScript type:** `number`

**Standard use case:** Creating custom chess variants with different board sizes.

<Canvas of={ChessboardColumnsStories.ChessboardColumns} />

### `options.chessboardRows`

Controls the number of rows on the chessboard. If you set either of the row or column options above `9`, you will need to use the `positionObject` notation for the `position` prop, as `fen` notation only supports single digit columns.

**Default value:** `8`

**TypeScript type:** `number`

**Standard use case:** Creating custom chess variants with different board sizes.

<Canvas of={ChessboardRowsStories.ChessboardRows} />

### `options.clearArrowsOnClick`

Controls whether **internal** arrows are cleared when a square is clicked. If you are passing in external arrows via the [`arrows`](#optionsarrows) prop, these will not be automatically cleared when a square is clicked. Instead, you will need to clear them manually using the [`onSquareClick`](#optionsonsquareclick) prop and pass in a new value for the [`arrows`](#optionsarrows) prop.

**Default value:** `true`

**TypeScript type:** `boolean`

**Standard use case:** Disabling the ability to clear internal arrows when a square is clicked.

<Canvas of={ClearArrowsOnClickStories.ClearArrowsOnClick} />

### `options.clearArrowsOnPositionChange`

Controls whether **internal** arrows are cleared when the position changes. If you are passing in external arrows via the [`arrows`](#optionsarrows) prop, these will not be automatically cleared when the position changes. Instead, you will need to clear them manually when updating the position and pass in a new value for the [`arrows`](#optionsarrows) prop.

**Default value:** `true`

**TypeScript type:** `boolean`

**Standard use case:** Disabling the ability to clear internal arrows when the position changes.

<Canvas of={ClearArrowsOnPositionChangeStories.ClearArrowsOnPositionChange} />

### `options.darkSquareNotationStyle`

Controls the styling of notation on dark squares. If you wish to instead hide the notation, set [`showNotation`](#optionsshownotation) to `false`.

This is separate from the [`alphaNotationStyle`](#optionsalphanotationstyle) prop, which controls the styling of the notation on all alpha squares.

[`alphaNotationStyle`](#optionsalphanotationstyle) and [`numericNotationStyle`](#optionsnumericnotationstyle) will take precedence over this style for any clashing properties.

**Default value:**

```tsx
{
  color: "#F0D9B5",
}
```

**TypeScript type:** `React.CSSProperties`

**Standard use case:** Ensuring notation is readable on dark squares by adjusting color and size.

{
  backgroundColor: "#B58863",
}
```

**TypeScript type:** `React.CSSProperties`

**Standard use case:** Customizing the appearance of dark squares to match your application's theme.

<Canvas of={DarkSquareStyleStories.DarkSquareStyle} />

### `options.dragActivationDistance`

Controls the distance in pixels that the mouse needs to move before a piece can be dragged. Note that setting this to `0` will cause issues with the `onPieceClick` event firing because the click will be registered as a drag instead.

**Default value:** `1`

**TypeScript type:** `number`

**Standard use case:** Preventing accidental piece dragging when clicking on a piece.

<Canvas of={DragActivationDistanceStories.DragActivationDistance} />

### `options.draggingPieceStyle`

Controls the styling of the piece being dragged. This allows you to customise the appearance of the piece while it's being dragged, such as scaling it up, adding a shadow, or rotating it.

**Default value:**

```tsx
{
  transform: 'scale(1.2)',
}
```

**TypeScript type:** `React.CSSProperties`

**Standard use case:** Enhancing the visual feedback when dragging pieces, such as making the dragged piece larger or adding effects to make it stand out.

<Canvas of={DraggingPieceStyleStories.DraggingPieceStyle} />

### `options.draggingPieceGhostStyle`

Controls the styling of the ghost piece that remains in the original square while dragging. This allows you to customize the appearance of the ghost piece, such as its opacity or blur effect.

**Default value:**

```tsx
{
  opacity: 0.5,
}
```

**TypeScript type:** `React.CSSProperties`

**Standard use case:** Customizing the visual feedback of the ghost piece to make it more or less prominent while dragging.

**Default value:** `"chessboard"`

**TypeScript type:** `string`

**Standard use case:** Handling multiple chessboards on the same page or directly targeting the chessboard component with JS or CSS.

### `options.lightSquareNotationStyle`

Controls the styling of notation on light squares. If you wish to instead hide the notation, set [`showNotation`](#optionsshownotation) to `false`.

This is separate from the [`alphaNotationStyle`](#optionsalphanotationstyle) prop, which controls the styling of the notation on all alpha squares.

[`alphaNotationStyle`](#optionsalphanotationstyle) and [`numericNotationStyle`](#optionsnumericnotationstyle) will take precedence over this style for any clashing properties.

**Default value:**
