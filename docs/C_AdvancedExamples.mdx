# Advanced examples

These examples demonstrate more complex use cases for React Chessboard. Each example includes explanations of key concepts and code snippets showing how to implement them.

<HintMessage>
  The code shown in the "Show code" dropdowns for each example does show the
  full code where possible, but it is not formatted in an ideal way and hides
  any helpful import statements. It is highly recommended to view the code in
  the [GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard/tree/main/docs/stories/advanced-examples)
  to see the code in a more readable format.

### Analysis board

This example shows you how to implement an analysis board with the component. The analysis board is a board that shows a chess engine's evaluation of the current position and the best move it thinks can be played.

The engine used in this example is [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), which is a free and open-source chess engine. In this example we are using the [stockfish.wasm](https://github.com/lichess-org/stockfish.wasm) library by Lichess, which is a WebAssembly build of Stockfish.

To implement the analysis board, there are a few key requirements:

1. **Web Worker Implementation**: The chess engine runs in a web worker to prevent blocking the main thread. This ensures the UI remains responsive while the engine is calculating moves. You can learn more about web workers in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

2. **Required Files**: You'll need to include two additional files in your project:

   - `stockfish.wasm.js`: The JavaScript wrapper for the WebAssembly engine
   - `stockfish.wasm`: The actual WebAssembly binary of the Stockfish engine

   These files should be placed in your public directory so they can be accessed by the web worker. You can download these files from the [react-chessboard repository](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard/tree/main/docs/stockfish):

   - [stockfish.wasm.js](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard/blob/main/docs/stockfish/stockfish.wasm.js)
   - [stockfish.wasm](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard/blob/main/docs/stockfish/stockfish.wasm)

3. **Engine Helper Class**: The example uses a helper class called `Engine` to simplify interaction with the Stockfish engine. This class:

   - Initializes the web worker
   - Handles communication with the engine
   - Provides methods for position evaluation and move calculation
   - Manages the engine's lifecycle

   You can find the complete implementation of the Engine class in the [react-chessboard repository](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard/blob/main/docs/stockfish/engine.ts).

### Mini puzzles

This example shows you how to implement a mini puzzle with the component. This example is inspired from the mate in two puzzles in the [Pocket Chess](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dkxqzbfkjt.pocketchess&hl=en_GB&pli=1) app. It highlights the ability to create non-standard boards with logic following predefined moves.

### Multiplayer

This example demonstrates how to implement a multiplayer chess experience with the component. This aims to highlight a centralised game state where each player can see the board from their own perspective.

In examples where the game is played over a network, the player should have a local game state and a remote game state. The local game state is the game state that the player sees on their own board, and the remote game state is the game state that the player sees on the opponent's board. These should be kept in sync by sending the game state to the opponent over the network. In this scenario, the local player would immediately see their board update, and the remote player would receive that update with a delay equal to the time it takes to send the game state to the opponent over the network.

### Premoves

This example shows you how can you implement premoves with the component. Premoves are when you make a move and then before your opponent makes their move, you make a move to be played automatically after your opponent's move.

### Promotion piece selection

This example shows you how to implement promotion piece selection with the component by using the `onPieceDrop` prop to capture the promotion move, show a dialog to select the piece that the pawn will be promoted to, and then update the board `position` prop to update the board position to the promotion move.

### Four player chess

This example shows you how to implement a four player chess game with the component. This example is inspired from the [Four Player Chess](https://www.chess.com/variants/4-player-chess) variant on Chess.com. It highlights the ability to create a non-standard board with multiple orientations and piece colours.

### 3D board

This example shows you how to implement a 3D chessboard with the component by using the `boardStyle` prop to create a 3D board and the `pieces` prop to create 3D pieces with images.
