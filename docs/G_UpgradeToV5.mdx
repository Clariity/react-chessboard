# Upgrading to V5

This guide will help you upgrade your react-chessboard implementation from v4 to v5. The new version is a ground up rewrite that includes several breaking changes and new features that you'll need to be aware of.

React Chessboard v5 is **27% smaller** minified and **19% smaller** gzipped. With fewer dependencies, many more customisation options, and less opinionated internal logic.

## Breaking Changes

### React Version Requirement

- Minimum `react` version is now `19.0.0`
- Update your `react` and `react-dom` dependencies:

  ```bash
  pnpm add react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0
  # or
  yarn add react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0
  # or
  npm install react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0
  ```

### Node.js Requirement

- Minimum `node` version is now `20.11.0`

## API Changes

The v5 release includes significant changes to the API. Here's a detailed comparison of the changes:
