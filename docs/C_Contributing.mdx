## Project guidelines

## Project nuances

### DnD Kit Re-rendering

When using @dnd-kit for drag and drop functionality, it's important to note that all droppable and draggable elements will re-render on each drag event. This is due to how @dnd-kit tracks the position and state of draggable elements.

To optimize performance:

- Use React.memo on draggable/droppable components where possible
- Keep draggable components lightweight
- Avoid expensive calculations or operations in draggable components
- Consider using CSS transforms for animations instead of JavaScript

### Performance Considerations

- Components are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- CSS transforms are used for animations instead of JavaScript
- Drag overlay uses a cloned piece to maintain performance
- Position updates are batched to minimize re-renders
- Square and piece components are kept lightweight

### Dependencies

- less dependencies the better
- use react 19+

### Future Considerations

The following features are planned or under consideration:

- Multiple board support
- Accessibility improvements
- Promotion handling
- Premoves
- Arrows
- Comprehensive test suite
- CI/CD pipeline with semantic versioning

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No IE11 support required
- Mobile browser support for touch events

### Accessibility

- Use ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation is available
- Provide clear feedback for user actions

## Getting Help
